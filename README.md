# Deep-Learning
This repository contains projects based on Deep Learning models (architectures of neural networks)

With the increase of computational power and amounts of available data, but also with the development of novel training algorithms and new whole approaches, many breakthroughs occurred over the few last years in Deep Learning for object and spoken language recognition, text generation, and robotics. These projects cover the fundamental aspects and the recent developments in deep learning in different domains: Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Deep Reinforcement Learning.
